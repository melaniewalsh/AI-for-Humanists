title: BERT for Humanists
---
In the past three years, natural language processing research has been revolutionized by a new technology: contextual embeddings such as ELMo, GPT-2, and especially [**BERT**](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html).

 These state-of-the-art methods can understand human language significantly better than previous methods. For example, BERT can disambiguate between multivalent words — *<b>bank</b> accounts* and *river <b>bank</b>* — with never-before-seen levels of accuracy.

What impact might BERT-like models have in the field of the digital humanities? What impact might digital humanists have on our understanding and application of BERT-like methods? 

The **BERT for Humanists** project is developing resources to help answer these questions and enable DH scholars to explore how BERT-like models can be used in their research and teaching. Find an [annotated bibliography](bibliography) of research papers and tools, a [glossary](glossary) of relevant terms, code [tutorials](tutorials), and information about our virtual [workshop](workshops) in June 2021.
