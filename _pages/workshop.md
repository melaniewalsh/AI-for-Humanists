# BERT for Humanists Virtual Workshop

**Friday June 4th, 2021 â€” 1pm-3pm Eastern**

**Hosted by David Mimno, Melanie Walsh, and Maria Antoniak**

*You can register for the [Zoom workshop here](https://cornell.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0kd-6trTMuGdQQBOa4mLM7_8WrOzZawwLE)*

In the last three years, natural language processing researchers have been abuzz about a state-of-the-art method called BERT...

## Details
What is BERT? How do you use it? What kinds of digital humanities projects will BERT be most useful for?

This free, two-hour virtual workshop will begin to answer these important questions about BERT-like models and their potential role in DH research and teaching.

We will first offer a brief conceptual overview of BERT. Then we will dive into a hands-on, code-based tutorial that demonstrates how to train and fine-tune a BERT model with [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html)'s popular Python library `transformers`. This demonstration will be focused on humanistic data, including poetry and Goodreads book reviews.

## Who is this workshop for?
This workshop is primarily geared toward digital humanists and computational social scientists who are familiar with Python and have a basic knowledge of machine learning. However, all participants with an interest in the humanities and social sciences are welcome.

We would like to emphasize that this is not a general-purpose BERT workshop.

## Where do I sign up?
You can register for the [Zoom workshop here.](https://cornell.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0kd-6trTMuGdQQBOa4mLM7_8WrOzZawwLE)

## What can I do to prepare?
You might review some of the basic machine learning concepts and tools that we will drawn upon during the workshop, such as training and testing and the Python library `scikit-learn`:
- "The 7 Steps of Machine Learning," Yufeng Guo

- ["A Beginners Guide to Scikit-Learn"](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-scikit-learn-14b7e51d71a4), Rebecca Vickery

You might also familiarize yourself with Google Colab notebooks, which will be using extensively throughout the workshop:
- ["Welcome to Colaboratory"](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)

## What if I can't make it?
We're sorry to miss you! We plan to release selected recordings from the workshop on YouTube.
