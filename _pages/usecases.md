# Examples of uses for AI models

## Managing sources

### OCR and image to text

- **[Leveraging LLMs for Post-OCR Correction of Historical Newspapers](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lt4hala-1.14.pdf)** by Alan Thomas, Robert Gaizauskas, and Haiping Lu (2024)

    - *This paper compares the ability of a prompted Llama 2 model and a fine-tuned BART model to correct character-level errors in the OCR of 19th C British newspaper articles.*

- **[Uncovering the Handwritten Text in the Margins: End-to-end Handwritten Text Detection and Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05929)** by Liang Cheng, Jonas Frankemölle, Adam Axelsson, and Ekta Vats (2024)

    - *This paper presents a pipeline for computationally extracting marginalia and an evaluation of the pipeline on the early book collection in the Uppsala University Library.*

- **[Enhancing HTR of Historical Texts through Scholarly Editions: A Case Study from an Ancient Collation of the Hebrew Bible](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/paper6310.pdf)** by Luigi Bambaci and Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra (2023)

    - *A case study that makes use of OCR, image alignment, and more to produce an electronic scholarly edition of Kennicott's Hebrew bible.*

### Parsing difficult text

### Translation

## Adding annotations

### Classification / coding

- **[Modeling Legal Reasoning: LM Annotation at the Edge of Human Agreement](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.575.pdf)** by Rosamond Thalken, Edward H. Stiglitz, David Mimno, and Matthew Wilkens (2023)

    - *This paper discusses how to use LLMs effectively for annotating modes of legal reasoning in a corpus of United States Supreme Court Decisions.*

### Named entity identification

### Stylometry

- **[T5 meets Tybalt: Authorship Attribution in Early Modern English Drama Using Large Language Models](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3558/paper2757.pdf)** by Rebecca M. M. Hicke and David Mimno (2023)

 - *This paper explores the ability of medium-sized large language models to perform authorship attribution with very short segments of text in the difficult setting of Early Modern English drama.*

## Getting an overview

### Corpus visualization

### Word representations and similarity

- **[Diachronic Word Embeddings Reveal Statistical Laws of Semantic Change](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1141.pdf)** by William L. Hamilton, Jure Leskovec, and Dan Jurafsky (2016)

    - *This work develops a method for using word embeddings to track semantic drift over time and uses it to develop two quantitative laws of semantic change.*

- **[Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4230)** by Aylin Caliskan, Joanna J. Bryson, and Arvind Narayanan (2017)

    - *This paper uses static word embeddings trained on web corpora to show that machine learning methods can result in human-like biases.*

- **[Discovering Differences in the Representation of People using Contextualized Semantic Axes](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.228.pdf)** by Li Lucy, Divya Tadimeti, and David Bamman (2022)

    - *This work uses contextual embeddings from BERT to construct semantic axes along which words can be placed and validates that this method can separate instances of the same word type and track how word associations have drifted in several corpora over time.*
