What is BERT? How do you use it? What kinds of digital humanities projects and humanistic questions will BERT be most useful for?

This two-hour virtual workshop will begin to answer these important questions about BERT-like models and their potential role in digital humanities research and teaching. We will first offer a brief conceptual overview of BERT, and then we will dive into a hands-on, code-based tutorial that demonstrates how to train and fine-tune a BERT model with the Python library HuggingFace and humanistic data, including poetry and Goodreads book reviews.

This workshop is primarily geared toward participants who are familiar with Python and who have a basic knowledge of machine learning, but all are welcome. For a brief review of machine learning concepts that will be useful to know during the workshop, see the following resources:
